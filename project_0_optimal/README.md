### Project description
Guess the number, randomly given by PC, in minimum amount of tryes

### What case we are solwing?
We need to dewelop a programm, which could guess randomly given number in minimum amount of tryes

**Terms:**
- PC randomly gives us a number between 1 and 100, and we need to guess it. "Guess" means we need to dewelop a programm that could guess the number
- Algorithm should consider if number in current iteration is more or less then one we need to guess

**Quality metrics**

Results evaluates on mean amount of tryes within 1000 cicles. Amount of tryes schould be as small as possible.

**Practice goal**

Nice and clean code on Python writing practice
IDE working practice
GitHub working practice

### Shorts about data

Randomly given number between 1 and 100

### Project stages

Only one for now.

### Results

Three functions were created:
- Simplest one just randomly guessing the number.
- Adwanced one still randomly guessing the number - but within schrinking borders
- Final one utilise idea of shrinking borders without any random at all.

### Conclusions

Not so hard, but prety usefull if we talk about expirience.
Also we can make an obvious conclusion - it`s always better when you know what are you doing.
According to our game - than less we randomize than better is outcome.
