### What case we are solwing?
We need to make preparations on raw data for futher model creation, including:.   
- basic analysys;
- data transformation;
- emply cells filling;
- feature selection; 
- categorial features encoding;
- feature scaling;
- feature significance analysys.
After preparings are done, we need to create and optimise a bunch of classification models.

**Terms:**

We should follow given roadmap from teamplate Jupiter Notebook.

**Quality metrics**

Accuracy and f1 score, calculated after applying model to test dataset.

**Practice goal**

Nice and clean code on Python writing practice

IDE working practice

GitHub working practice

Data visualization practice

Conclusions making practice

Natural language processing, geocoding, feature encoding, feature scaling, featyre significance analysys

Mashine learning practice, in case of classification models.

### Shorts about data

11162 records with raw information about bank clients.   

Each record has following structure:      
 0   age        11162 non-null  int64    
 1   job        11162 non-null  object   
 2   marital    11162 non-null  object   
 3   education  11162 non-null  object   
 4   default    11162 non-null  object   
 5   balance    11137 non-null  object   
 6   housing    11162 non-null  object   
 7   loan       11162 non-null  object   
 8   contact    11162 non-null  object   
 9   day        11162 non-null  int64    
 10  month      11162 non-null  object   
 11  duration   11162 non-null  int64    
 12  campaign   11162 non-null  int64    
 13  pdays      11162 non-null  int64    
 14  previous   11162 non-null  int64    
 15  poutcome   11162 non-null  object   
 16  deposit    11162 non-null  object   

 There ara a bunch og non-numeric features, and some empty cells in dataset.
 Also there are outliers according to some features.

### Project stages

1. Lib improt   
2. Data examination, empty cells and outliers   
3. Exploratory data analysis   
4. Data transform   
5. Classification task solving: logistic regression and decision trees
6. Classification task solving: ensembles of models and forecasting

### Results

Succesfull optimisation and comclusions about futher bank strategy.
