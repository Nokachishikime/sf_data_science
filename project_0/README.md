### Project description
Guess the number, randomly given by PC, in minimum amount of tryes

### What case we are solwing?
We need to dewelop a programm, which could guess our number in minimum amount of tryes

**Terms:**
- PC randomly gives us a number between 1 and 100, and we need to guess it. "Guess" means we need to dewelop a programm that could guess the number
- Algorithm should consider if number in current iteration is more or less then one we need to guess

**Quality metrics**

Results evaluates on mean amount of tryes within 1000 cicles

**Practice goal**

To write nice and clean code on Python

### Shorts about data

Randomly given number

### Project stages

Only one

### Results

Two functions solving it

### Conclusions

Not so hard, but prety usefull if we talk about expirience
